# Coworkers & Coffee... Who should pay?

This script determines which coworker should pay for coffee on a given day.



## Prerequisites
Python 3.x

## Installation
Clone this repository using ```git clone https://github.com/kyljgr/coworkers_coffee```

## Usage
Run the script using ```python3 coworkers_coffee.py```

**Note:**

The selected coworker who should pay for coffee will be outputted to the terminal.

The resulting JSON file (MM_DD_YYYY.json) will use the current date.  For testing purposes, please rename the JSON file (anything you'd like), so the file is not overwritten and results can be traced.

When the program is run, you will be prompted to use a previous coffee order file.  The first time the program is run, select ```n```.

Following the first program run, you will be able to use the resultant JSON file in order to base the next day's result on the previous day.

The folder tests_r2 is provided to show sample results over a 12 day period.
